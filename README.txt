Classification Modeling Project: Predicting Depressive Disorders
Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate multiple classification models to predict whether a person has experienced a depressive disorder using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey Data from 2020. The dataset consists of 5000 tuples with 276 attributes, where each tuple represents a person and the target variable 'Class' indicates whether the person has experienced a depressive disorder ('Y') or not ('N').

Dataset
The dataset 'project_dataset-5K.csv' has been preprocessed and provided for this project. However, further preprocessing is required, including handling missing values, cleaning, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.

Goal
The main goal of this project is to:

Perform preprocessing on the dataset as needed.
Build multiple classification models using various algorithms.
Compare the performance of these models and select the best one.
Fulfill the process, performance, and deliverable requirements outlined in the project guidelines.
Process Requirements
Utilize any preprocessing methods and classification algorithms to find a model with high performance.
Use R for building and testing classification models.
Employ at least three attribute selection methods and two methods to create balanced datasets.
Implement at least six different classification algorithms.
Performance Requirements
Refer to the "Grading Guideline" section provided in the project guidelines document.

Deliverable Requirements
Refer to the "Final Report" section provided in the project guidelines document.
